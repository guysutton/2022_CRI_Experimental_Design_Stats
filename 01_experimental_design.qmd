## Designing an ecological study 

The practical steps needed for planning and conducting an ecology study include: 

::: {.incremental}
1. Identify the research question / problem statement
2. Selecting treatment variables, levels and ranges
3. Selecting an appropriate response variable
4. Choosing an appropriate experimental structure 
5. Performing the actual experiment
6. Statistical analysis
7. Drawing inferences
8. Communicating results 
:::

Today, we are going to focus on 2-4...

## Basic Principles of Experimental Design 

::: {.incremental}
1. Randomisation
2. Replication
3. Blocking 
:::

---

## 1. Randomisation

::: {.incremental}
- Inference and proper statistical analysis require that data/measurements are independent
- True independence is (usually) impossible
- We can do multiple things to maximise independence:
  + 1. Take a random sample from the population 
  + 2. Assign treatments randomly to the experimental units
- Randomisation reduces bias and increases the estimation/accuracy of our treatment effect 
:::

---

## 2. Replication

::: {.incremental}
- Most scientists fully appreciate the need for replication 
- The problem being is that there is often a mismatch between the scale of the replication and the treatments we apply
  + We apply the replication at the wrong spatial or temporal scales
  + More on this later ... 
  
- Replication allows us to distinguish between differences between the treatments we apply versus confounding variables / background noise
:::

---

## 3. Blocking

::: {.incremental}
- Blocking is used to include other factors in our experiment which contribute to undesirable variation.
- Good experimental design is largely dependent on using 'blocks' effectively to control for background variation and other factors that can introduce bias into our experiments and results. 
  + For example, you could run a field trial on multiple farms (the 'block') to account for differences in environmental conditions between farms when looking at herbiduce efficacy. 
- By using blocks, we can avoid biases that may occur due to differences between the allocation of subjects to the treatments, and as a way of accounting for some noise in the experiment
:::

## The Experimental Unit 

This is the most important facet to designing good experiments. 

::: {.incremental}
- *Experimental unit*: The smallest unit or physical entity that can receive any treatment. 
  + This is the entity the researcher wants to make inferences about
- *Sampling unit*: The physical entity from which the measurements/observations are taken. 
:::

---

## The Experimental Unit 

::: {.incremental}
- For example, let's consider a study investigating the effect of herbicide application on FCM survival in the soil. 
  + Two fish tanks are used, each filled with soil, and 20 FCM larvae placed in each tank. 
  + One tank was sprayed with water (control) and the other tank sprayed with a herbicide solution (treatment).
  + The measurement was whether each FCM larvae pupated or not.

## The Experimental Unit - Round 2

What about if we filled 500ml cups with soil and placed individual FCM larvae into each cup?

## Experimental units = sample size 

:::{.incremental}
- One of the most common mistakes I see is researchers equating 'number of samples = no. of replicates/sample size'
  + [Number of samples usually DOES NOT equal sample size]{style="color:#cc0000"}
  + [Number of complete experimental units EQUALS sample size!!!]{style="color:#cc0000"}
  + i.e. Sample size = number of times we are able to apply our full set of treatments

- As such, we need to replicate the experiment based on experimental units, not sample units.
